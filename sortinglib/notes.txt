1) will not work on floating types because of ceiling function

2) delete reduction messages

3) instead of std::min and std::max, define inline min and max

4) for minmax, use lesser number of comparisons for minmax operations like std::minmax

5) possibility of a data race in sortinglib.h 122

6) change int reductions to uint64_t reductions, change checkgoal
